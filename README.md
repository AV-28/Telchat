This is a Client Server Application, implemented in java. Telnet Client is used and TCP Server is used. Client can
continuously communicate with the server unless the exit command is entered on client side (Connection closed on entering this).
Client can request the server by using get, put and delete commands by providing appropriate keys and values.
Server can handle the requests sent by client, post data back to the client depending on commands. Over Telnet Client user may enter as:
  Get <key> to get value corresponding to the key.
  Put <key> <value> to insert value corresponding to the key.
  Delete <key> to delete the key.
Along with this, invalid commands are also handled with the error showing possible commands user can do. Various conditions
(possible test cases) are handled on TCP server.
Also, adding a Client file implemented in java ...
